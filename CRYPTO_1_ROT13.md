## Information

### What is ROT13 ?
ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", sometimes hyphenated ROT-13) is a simple letter substitution cipher 
that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of 
the Caesar cipher which was developed in ancient Rome. 

#### Algorithm
Only those letters which occur in the English alphabet are affected; numbers, symbols, whitespace, 
and all other characters are left unchanged. Because there are 26 letters in the English alphabet 
and 26 = 2 Ã— 13, the ROT13 function is its own inverse:<br>
`ROT13(ROT13(x)) = x` for any basic Latin-alphabet text x.<br>
<br>
In other words, two successive applications of ROT13 restore the original text (in mathematics, 
this is sometimes called an involution; in cryptography, a reciprocal cipher).

### tr command
It is an abbreviation of translate or transliterate, indicating its operation of replacing or 
removing specific characters in its input data set. <br>
`tr SET1 [SET2]` set2 replace set1
